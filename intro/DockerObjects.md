# Docker Objects

Images, Containers, Volumes and Networks are the basic components of the Docker.

Images
---
Docker images are read-only templates with instructions to create a docker container.
Docker image can be pulled from a Docker hub and used as it is, or you can add additional
instructions to the base image and create a new and modified docker image.
You can create your own docker images also using a dockerfile.
Create a dockerfile with all the instructions to create a container and run it;
it will create your custom docker image.

Docker image has a base layer which is read-only, and the top layer can be written.
It is only allowed to create a new image on the top of the existing layers.

 #* [example docker image](../codes/image/exampleDockerFile)

Containers
---

After you run a docker image, it creates a docker container.
All the applications and their environment run inside this container.
You can use Docker API or CLI to start, stop, delete a docker container.

Below is a sample command to run a ubuntu docker container:

 * [docker container commands](../codes/container/commands.md)

Volumes
---

The persisting data generated by docker and used by Docker containers are stored in Volumes.
They are completely managed by docker through docker CLI or Docker API.
Volumeâ€™s content exists outside the lifecycle of a container, so using volume does not increase the size of a container.

For more details:
 * [docker volume commands](../codes/volume/commands.md)
 
Networks
---

Docker networking is a passage through which all the isolated container communicate.
There are mainly five network drivers in docker:

* Bridge: It is the default network driver for a container.
* Host: This driver removes the network isolation between docker containers and docker host. 
* Overlay: This network enables swarm services to communicate with each other.
* None: This driver disables all the networking.
* macvlan: This driver assigns mac address to containers to make them look like physical devices.

 * [docker network commands](../codes/network/commands.md)
